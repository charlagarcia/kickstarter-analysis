# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
1. Import data into a table for analysis.   
2. Apply filters, conditional formatting, and formulas.   
3. Generate and interpret pivot tables.   
4. Calculate summary statistics such as measures of central tendency, standard deviation, and variance.   
5. Characterize data to identify outliers in datasets.   
6. Perform an Excel analysis with visualizations.   
7. Interpret common Excel visualizations.

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
   - Launching in the Spring is ideal.
   - There is minimal risk of cancelation throughout the year. However, December is the least successful month.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  The most successful ranges are $0 - $20,000 and $35,000 - $45,000.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
  Information on canceled plays is not available for October.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - Outcomes based on country.
  - Outcomes based on average donation.
